# Life_expectancy
This project builds machine learning models to predict life expectancy based on health, economic, and demographic features. It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, multiple regression models, and evaluation using metrics like RÂ² and MAE. The best-performing model, Random Forest Regressor, is deployed using a Streamlit web app.
